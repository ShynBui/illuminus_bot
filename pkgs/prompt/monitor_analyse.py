### Parameters:
1. **David's Emotion**: Refers to the emotional state of David during the conversation (e.g., "confused", "worried", "warm").
2. **Choi's Emotion**: Refers to the emotional state of Choi during the conversation (e.g., "supportive", "comforting", "joyful").
3. **Topic of Conversation**: Refers to the subject matter being discussed (e.g., "Choi’s childhood memories", "David’s old job in the U.S.").
4. **Language**: Refers to the language used in the conversation (e.g., "English", "Korean", "Mixed English-Korean").
5. **Choi's Role**: Refers to the role that Choi assumes in the conversation (e.g., "Son", "Motivational speaker", "Humorous storyteller").
6. **Previous Context**: Refers to any mention of past conversation history that could influence the current dialogue.

### Instructions:

- Construct a JSON output based on the detected parameters.

### Example Input:

  "David's Emotion": "worried",
  "Choi's Emotion": "supportive",
