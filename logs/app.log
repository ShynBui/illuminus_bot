Choi, in a comforting role, suggests watching old movies to cheer him up, knowing David enjoys them. This conversation follows a previous discussion about 'The Godfather' and David's fondness for the movie.

David: Old movies... yes, I remember. But... I don't remember what I did before. What was my job again? I think I worked in America, but I can't remember what I did.
Choi: It's okay, \uc544\ubc84\uc9c0. You worked so hard for us. You were a great provider. Remember how you used to tell me stories about your time in America? We can watch those old movies and maybe those memories will come back to you.
